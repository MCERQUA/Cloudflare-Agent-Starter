## Best Practices for Images in Cloudflare Workers

When adding images to your Cloudflare Worker project, consider the following best practices:

1. **Optimize image sizes**: Large images can impact performance. Use appropriate formats and compression.
2. **Consider using Cloudflare Images**: For production applications, consider using [Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/) for optimized delivery.
3. **Use SVGs when possible**: SVGs are scalable and typically smaller in file size for simple graphics.
4. **Implement responsive images**: Use different image sizes for different device sizes.
5. **Lazy load images**: Load images only when they are about to enter the viewport.
6. **Add alt text**: Ensure all images have appropriate alt text for accessibility.
7. **Cache properly**: Set appropriate cache headers for images.

## Image Storage Options

For Cloudflare Workers projects, you have several options for storing and serving images:

1. **Bundled with worker**: Small, essential images can be bundled directly with your worker code.
2. **Cloudflare R2**: Store larger images in Cloudflare R2 object storage.
3. **Cloudflare KV**: Store small images in KV storage (with size limitations).
4. **Cloudflare Images**: Use Cloudflare's image optimization and delivery service.
5. **External CDN**: Use an external CDN for image hosting.

Choose the appropriate option based on your project's needs and scale.
