# Cloudflare Workers Overview

## What are Cloudflare Workers?

Cloudflare Workers are a serverless execution environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. They run on Cloudflare's edge network, which spans more than 300 cities in over 100 countries, putting your code closer to your users.

## Key Features and Benefits

### 1. Edge Computing

- **Global Deployment**: Your code runs on Cloudflare's global network, closer to your users
- **Low Latency**: Reduced latency compared to traditional server architectures
- **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy across the Cloudflare network

### 2. Serverless Architecture

- **No Server Management**: No need to provision, scale, or maintain servers
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scales with traffic
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for the compute time you use

### 3. Developer Experience

- **Modern JavaScript/TypeScript**: Write in JavaScript, TypeScript, or WebAssembly
- **Local Development**: Test locally with Wrangler CLI
- **Integrated Testing**: Built-in testing tools

### 4. Performance

- **Cold Start**: Near-zero cold start times
- **Execution Limits**: Up to 30 seconds of CPU time per request
- **Memory**: 128MB of memory per worker

### 5. Integrations

- **Cloudflare Services**: Integrate with other Cloudflare services like KV, Durable Objects, R2 Storage
- **External APIs**: Connect to external APIs and services
- **Bindings**: Bind to various resources like databases, object storage, etc.

## Use Cases

Cloudflare Workers are versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications:

1. **API Endpoints**: Create serverless API endpoints
2. **Web Applications**: Build complete web applications
3. **Edge Functions**: Run code at the edge to modify requests/responses
4. **A/B Testing**: Implement A/B testing at the edge
5. **Authentication**: Add authentication layers
6. **Content Transformation**: Transform content on the fly
7. **Webhooks**: Process webhook events
8. **Scheduled Tasks**: Run scheduled tasks with Cron Triggers

## Limitations

While powerful, Cloudflare Workers do have some limitations:

- **Execution Time**: Limited to 30 seconds of CPU time per request
- **Memory**: Limited to 128MB of memory
- **Environment**: Runs in a V8 isolate, not a full Node.js environment
- **File System**: No access to a traditional file system
- **Dependencies**: Limited to what can be bundled with your worker

## Pricing

Cloudflare Workers offers both free and paid plans:

- **Free Plan**: 100,000 requests per day, limited to 10ms CPU time per request
- **Paid Plan**: Starting at $5/month for 10 million requests, with 50ms CPU time per request
